# AdventOfCode2023

This is my take on AoC 2023.

## Focus this year:

* Leaner setup. So far I've used a self-written "framework" where I'd auto-download and add new days through a very exhaustive OOP setup in C#. Not that it was a very good framework to begin with. I'm attempting to utilize more efficient means of running things.
* F# as my focus language. I gave this a try for a few solutions last year and quite liked it. So, I wanna try a more functional approach.

As always, I'll be benchmarking my solution through BenchmarkDotNet and provide all necessary info for the benchmark.
